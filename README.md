This repository is a public workspace for notebooks and other material related to developing a suite of template-based UrbanSim model components.

## Tips and guidelines

Let's use sub-directories for distinct projects, particularly if they require variations to data schemas or base data. Setting a notebook's working directory to a particular sub-folder will give it access to the configs, scripts, and base data it contains.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/ual/urbansim_parcel_bayarea/wiki) for more resources.


## Updates

9-3-2018: Moved older material into a "summer-2018-model" directory and created new directories for parcel and unit model work.
